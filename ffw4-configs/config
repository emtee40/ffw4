# Configuration for floppyfw

# $Id: config,v 1.12 2005/09/24 17:50:01 thomasez Exp $

#
# Fill in the blanks.
#

# For configuring of modules to use, 
# this includes the network interfaces: /modules.lst

# For configuring firewall rules and incoming traffic: /firewall.ini
# For configuring extra network interfaces you may use netwirk.ini

# Serial console is set in syslinux.cfg (or isolinux.cfg for CD's)

# The default internal network is 10.42.42.* with 10.42.42.1
# As the floppyfw internal address (and default gateway for all
# internal machines). To change this go down to the INSIDE section.

#=============================================================================
#
# Basic configuration:
#

# Select the type of your OUTSIDE connection:

# CONNECT_TYPE=PPP	# if you use a modem

# CONNECT_TYPE=PPPoE    # if you use some type of DSL that uses PPPoE
                        # (Most of them do)
CONNECT_TYPE=DHCP       # For getting the IP address by DHCP, often used 
                        # on cable modems.

DHCP_USE_LAST_ADDR=y	# I'll make this new feature a default yes.
			# Reason is simple; I Want it and I presume
			# most others want it aswell.
			# Since it tries to store the address on the
			# root / source media, this only works with a 
			# writeable source.

# CONNECT_TYPE=STATIC	# For the good old LAN/WAN connections with
			# static IP addresses on the outside.
			# (setup of the interface is done further down 
			# in this file)

# CONNECT_TYPE=EXTERNAL # is a hook for booting a external startup
                        # script from a package.
                        # the external script has to be in /etc/ext-up.init

#
# Some connection methods wants a userid and password, PPP and PPPoE 
# is the typical but also the EXTERNAL option may want it.
# This is also where you can put the hostname/user id that some DHCP servers
# and ISPs require.
#
USER_IDENT=
USER_PASSWORD=

#
# Use a DHCP server on the inside network. (This will turn on DNSMASQ aswell)
# (Dnsmasq is a dns cache.)
#
DHCP_SERVER=n

#
# Floppyfw now has a login prompt.
# Default, for now, is a login prompt and no password..
# You have to "login" as root.
#
# Password can be created in many ways. You have two (three) options, 
# DES_PASSWORD will accept a crypted string 
# PASSWORD will accept a string (the specific root password, 
#          minimum 5 characters, maximum 8.). 

# This will give you "ffw" as login password.
# DES_PASSWORD=nCLm5JgCK0G5U 
PASSWORD=ffw


# 
# Done! Your floppyfw should already work by now.
# Save this file and give it a first shot !
# Beneath are options for setting up more advanced stuff
# (including static network settings and ppp)

#=============================================================================
#
# Wonder shaper. http://lartc.org/wondershaper/
# 
# Set this to "y" if you want wonder shaper to run at startup.
WONDER_SHAPER=n

# This requires you to set the download and upload speed. 

# The speed you are receiving data (downlink), in Kbit:
DOWNLOAD_SPEED=2048

# The speed you are sending data (uplink), in Kbit:
UPLOAD_SPEED=256

#====================================
#
# VoIP Subsection of Wonder shaper (Disabled if WONDER_SHAPER=n)
#
# If you have a IP-Phone, set this to the IP address of the phone
# or the machine running the phone software and Wondershaper will be
# even better. If left blank will remove the VoIP RT10 Class completely.
PHONE_IP=

# PHONE_IP VoIP Class 10 RTP data - set to desired rate (90000 recommended)
# If left blank will remove the VoIP RT10 Class completely.
RT10=90000

# To forward RTP or SIP ports, set the appropriate FORWARD_XXX=y
# Note that forwarding udp ports will have security implications.
# VOIP rtp data ports - LOwest and HIghest port number in range 
# get from your VoIP provider
LO_RTPPORT=
HI_RTPPORT=
FORWARD_RTP=n

# INT - SIP priority ports - space separated if > 1
# get from your VoIP provider - normally "5060" or "5060 5061"
INTPORTS=""
FORWARD_SIP=n

#
# Physical device layout:
#
# In the files /etc/outside.info and /etc/inside.info you will see 
# OUTSIDE_DEVICE and INSIDE_DEVICE, those are the logical devices used by
# firewall.init and friends..
#
# If you have only one network card you can set INSIDE_DEV to eth0:0
# and it will use ip aliasing to make it all work.
#
# You can also use device.VLAN-ID to automatically set it as a VLAN.

#
# INSIDE settings:
#
# 
# Your inside network, this has 10.42.42.* set as default, this is

#
# Network and broadcast address will be automatically configured.
#
INSIDE_IP=10.42.42.1
INSIDE_NETMASK=255.255.255.0

# 
# If you use the internal DHCP server and change the IP address and range
# above you should also set the dhcp address range.
#
DHCP_RANGE_START=10.42.42.100  
DHCP_RANGE_END=10.42.42.200

# Misc
# These are not nescessary to set if you are using DHCP.
# (The DOMAIN field might be useful to change)
#
DEFAULT_GATEWAY=

# Name servers can be a list, separated by a space. like "1.1.1.1 1.1.1.2"
OUTSIDE_NAMESERVERS=""

# MAC address for outside nic
# Some ISPs uses bootp style dhcp tables and some just remembers the last
# used MAC address. this allows you to swap nics
# OUTSIDE_MAC=00:00:e8:48:6c:cb

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# DMZ settings. 
#
# You can also fine tune the firewall settings in dmz-fw.ini
#
# This can also be set up as the device/LAN for an open WLAN.
# As with the other interfaces, you can use device.VLAN-ID to automatically
# set it as a VLAN.
#
# Please note that enabling this automatically opens up for DNS requests to
# the floppyfw from DMZ.

# What traffic do you want to allow from DMZ to OUTSIDE?

# USEPEERDNS used to be here. it's now deprecated, or basically, it's 
# being turned on permanently.
# *but*, you can override it using the OUTSIDE_NAMESERVERS option you will 
# find further up in this config file. The ip-up script will create an 
# /etc/resolv.conf file with the OUTSIDE_NAMESERVERS as the first available
# name servers (if any are set) and then the LCP given addresses.

# Change the DEMAND variable to either:
# 'no' for "always on" connection
# N where N is the number of idle seconds before we disconnect
#DEMAND=600
DEMAND=no

# A debug option for debugging PPPoE, it will log to the specified file.
# This must NOT be used during normal use, it'll fill up the ramdisk..
