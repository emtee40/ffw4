ffw4

Homepage: http://www.zelow.no/floppyfw

The good old floppyfw, now generation 4.

But what will this be? It's still <a href="http://buildroot.org">Buildroot</a> based but this time without a devkit. You just download / clone ffw4 and buildroot, pick the defconfig you want (right now it's ffw4-vm for virtual machines and ffw4-pi for RaspberryPi.) and start making.

I will provide images aswell, and those will of course be found here. Images in a floppy? Sorry, no. I am pretty sure that's practically impossible, just the compiled kernel for vmfw is 1.9MB
